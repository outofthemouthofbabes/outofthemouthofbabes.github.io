# 21 May 2021: The best defence 

I have no clue what is going on with these vaccines! 
But what I do know is that God is asking us to have a party!
He is telling us to rejoice! In Psalm 35 we see David rejoicing (v9) in the Lord's salvation. 
In v27 David tells those who support his cause to rejoice. In Psalm 63 we see David again praising and rejoicing (v4, 5, 7, 11) in the wilderness. 
The title of this Psalm is "Joy in the Fellowship of God". We also know that the Joy of the Lord is our strength.
The Lord seems to be saying that in the midst of struggle, the best defence is joy.
We enter His gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise so praise gets us into His presence and there we have joy and there we have strength. 
We also know that out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants comes perfect praise. 
If joy is a tipping point in the battle then surely children must be a key.
