# 30 April 2021: Killing of the innocent

Baroness Oâ€™Cathain died a week ago today, at the age of 83. She was a member of the House of Lords for 30 years, a successful business woman and Patron of The Christian Institute. The Christian Institute mentioned in a [tribute to her](https://www.christian.org.uk/news/sorely-missed-institute-patron-detta-ocathain-remembered/) that she boldly spoke out on civil partnerships, assisted suicide, embryology laws and transgenderism over many years. 

I could not find any clear indication on Baroness O'Cathain's stance on abortion but, as I mentioned, she was a Patron of the Christian Instutute which is very clear about its stance on abortion and this week made mention of the [news](https://www.christian.org.uk/news/westminster-issues-ultimatum-over-ni-abortion-roll-out/) that the Secretary of State of Northern Ireland has been empowered by the House of Lords to commission abortion services across Northern Ireland. Another sad decision made on behalf of the voiceless millions of unborn babies that get slaughtered every year around the world. 

The question is ask is this: why have we been so worried about 100,000 people dying from COVID-19 in the last year in the UK when more than 200,000 unborn babies were killed in the same period and the only news is stories like the above telling us that new laws have been put in place to kill more babies?
