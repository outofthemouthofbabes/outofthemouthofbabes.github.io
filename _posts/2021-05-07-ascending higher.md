# 7 May 2021: Ascending higher

The words "trauma" and "abuse" have been popping up in conversations frequently recently.

I have heard from those who are traumatised and abused and those who minister to the traumatised and the abused.

When you hear this abuse or trauma from the mouth of the traumatised and abused it is hard to comprehend how Father God processes this. It seems so wrong, so unnecessary. 

What about the trauma of abortion I mentioned last week? This is beyond comprehension, not only for the baby but the parents as well.

Yet Father God calls us higher in His word. He says in 2 Corinthians 12:9, “My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.” Paul goes on to say that he therefore gladly boasts in his infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon him. 

My understanding is that aborted babies go straight to heaven. In their weakness the power of Christ delivers them instantly into a glorious eternity. We may not experience that immediate and complete relief from our trauma or abuse but we can ascend higher and walk in the revelation of the power of Christ strengthening us in the midst of our weakness.
