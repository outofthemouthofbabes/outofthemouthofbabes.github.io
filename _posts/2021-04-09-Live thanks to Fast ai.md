# 9 April 2021: Live!

The blog is live thanks to [Fast.ai](https://fast.ai/).

I hope to start adding content regularly soon. I am getting more and more concerned about and praying about the issues that children face.

They need a voice and this blog is a contribution in the form of a collection of thoughts and research that others can learn from and also pray about.

**"Out of the mouths of babes and nursing infants you have perfect praise" (Matthew 21:16)**
