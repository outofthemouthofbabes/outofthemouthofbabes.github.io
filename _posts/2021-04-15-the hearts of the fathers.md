Reading Psalm 3 we get some insight into David's pain when he was fleeing from Absalom, his own son.
What would make a father fear his own so much that he would flee? 
What makes a son so angry that he wants to pursue his own father with the plan to harm him?
In the story that precedes this point in Psalm 3 we see lots of brokeness in the behaviour of those involved. 
We see rape and deceit and unforgiveness. Yet though it all a desire for both David as father and Absalom as son to connect but sin getting in the way and hindering the process.
