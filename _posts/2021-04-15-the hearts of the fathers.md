# 23 April 2021: Hearts of the fathers

Reading Psalm 3 we get some insight into David's pain when he was fleeing from Absalom, his own son.
What would make a father fear his own son so much that he would flee? 
What makes a son so angry that he wants to pursue his own father with the plan to harm him?

In the story that precedes this point in Psalm 3 (2 Sam 15) we see lots of brokeness in the behaviour of those involved. 
We see rape and deceit and unforgiveness. Yet, through it all, a desire for both David, as father, and Absalom, as son, to connect but sin getting in the way and hindering the process.
First David shows his desire to reconnect with his son after Absalom had killed Amnon (2 Sam 13:39). 
Then David ordered Absalom's return to Jerusalem (2 Sam 14:21) but did not want to see Absalom (2 Sam 14:24).
For two years Absalom did not see David. What do you think went through his mind? 
“Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still.” is what 2 Sam 14:32 says he asked Joab to tell David.

David's heart had not turned to his son Absalom and Absalom's heart had not turned back to his father.
Malachi 4:6 tells us that this results in a curse.
Even though David and Absalom did reunite, we see the story ending with Absalom committing treason against his father and dying at the hands of David's soldiers even though David had instructed them not to harm Absalom. 
The story of David and Absalom is a somber reminder to us as the Ecclesia and as parents to always seek to build and restore relationship with our children just like Father God does with us.
